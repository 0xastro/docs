# Validators CLI and API 

## API 

There is a complete API for Helium Validators. It's [documented here as part of the Helium Blockchain API](/api/blockchain/validators).

## CLI 

The `validator` CLI functionality is part of the the Helium CLI Wallet. This section will highlight the relevant CLI commands for working with validators. For complete installation, usage docs, and source code, please see the [Helium CLI Wallet Repo on GitHub](https://github.com/helium/helium-wallet-rs).

$ helium-wallet create basic --network testnet
```

Note the `--network testnet` flag that results in a testnet-compatible wallet.

```
helium-wallet validators stake [FLAGS] <address> <stake>
